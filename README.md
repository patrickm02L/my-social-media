## About
If you're doing cool shit people want to know about it! They want to access it, and they want to access you. 

I've created this repo to link you to my social, but also to give you a sense of how to use it. Yes, it's a skill, and you need to get good at it - especially if you're a creator. You made it, you need to get credit for it.

### Defining Premises
* Document Everything!
* It doesn't matter what you do IRL, on the Internet you're a content creator. 
* Four Basic Types of Content: Audio, Images, Text, Video
* You don't need a website. Instead, keep a blog where you catch all the digital content you make. 
* Treat each social media application as a collection of your 'Basic Type of Content'.
* Respect the native format. I.E. Post the actual pic on the natvie platform, not a link from another app. BAD!   
* Meet people, share, and Have fun!

### Github - [patrickm02L](https://github.com/patrickm02L)
* **Audience:** Public. Coders and folks who want access to my files
* **Purpose:** Create web applications, Open Source my work-flow, share files and content 
* **Type of Content:** Code and files. 
* **Insights:** My favorite part about GitHub is that everything is up for grabs. Any code, any files, anything that's on the platform is for sharing. My second favorite part is the tracking! Finally, a way to see how much actual work and time I'm spending on stuff. I know GitHub is commonplace to the coding world, but when other disciplines finally wrap their brains around it, I think we'll really get to see the power of the collaborative economy. There IS a learning curve. I suggest the GitHub YouTube Channel, and JLord's github for folks just starting out.  

### Facebook - [patrickm02L](https://www.facebook.com/patrickm02L)
* **Audience:** Semi-private. Family, friends, college crowd, local news
* **Purpose:** Keep upto date with folks on a more personal level. 
* **Type of Content:** Post my stuff, friends stuff, local events, and info about orgs I support.
* **Insights:** This is the only private social media I have. I have a public setting, so folks can follow, but I mostly only converse with people I know In Real Life (IRL). I very much like the Instagram integration and pretty much exclusively upload pics to Facebook through Instagram these days. I've thought about getting rid of Facebook a few times, but I've unfollowed all the brands from my feed, and pretty much just get new from people I know. I'm also interested to see what facebook's gonna do with Occulus Rift, Virtual Reality. Game Change! 

### Instagram - [@patrickm02L](http://instagram.com/patrickm02l)
* **Audience:** Public. 
* **Purpose:** Everyday observations. The City, people, events, bike, my projects, travels, adventures, & secrets.
* **Type of Content:** Images
* **Insights:** When I first started, I Instagrammed everything, about a year into it I noticed that there were some really good folks who could tell great stories with their pics, and now I'm following in their footsteps and becoming more selective with my pics and frequency of posts. If you don't have any photography experience it's okay. Over time you'll start to see patterns in your picture taking. I even list them in my IG bio. Here are some quick pointers for good pics: symmetry, rule of thirds, perspective. Also, get an app to add filters, I use the VSCO cam app, and use the same 1-3 filters for all of your shots - that'll create consistency and help to refine your aesthetic. 

### LinkedIn - [patrickm02L](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickm02l)
* **Audience:** Public. People I've met.
* **Purpose:** Connect with folks in different industries. My only rule about this is that I have to have had an interaction with them at some point. Met at a conference, had a google hangout, something. No cold invites. 
* **Type of Content:** Audio, Images, Text, Video
* **Insights:** LinkedIn is a timeline of your work history. It's the new resume. So get one! The pay off is that when other people search you they can see that you're connected to someone they know. Other than that, I've found that it's a good place to post my blogs, conference news, and opportunities. I've also found out that if you post too much of your own stuff people yell at you for treating it like Facebook. Respect the native format and the function!

### Medium - [patrickm02L](https://medium.com/@patrickm02L)
* **Audience:** Public. Everyone. 
* **Purpose:** Write. Share your thoughts in text format. 
* **Type of Content:** Essays, personal narratives, short stories, how tos, tracking. 
* **Insights:** I think Medium is going to become as mainstream as Twitter. In part, because one of the co-founders of twitter, Ev Williams, created it, but also because of how easy it is to write and publish. Medium is an elegantly formatted blog for everyone, you don't have to be a pro, and it has a social media (twitter, facebook) infrastructure built into it. I think major companies and brands will start using it as their main platform for blogging too. If you're not on Medium, get on! 

### Pinterest - [patrickm02L](http://www.pinterest.com/patrickm02l/)
* **Audience:** Public. Everyone.
* **Purpose:** Collect Examples of things that I like, as a reference for my design stuff, and things that fit with my style and taste aesthetic. I also, use the Pin Boards to Showcase my Digitally content.  
* **Type of Content:** Images, Gifs 
* **Insights:** Between this and Tumblr I've never run out of ideas or things to inspire. It's a great way to keep up on all the latest, and I definitely steal a lot of ideas from here.

### Twitter - [@patrickm02L](https://twitter.com/patrickm02L)
* **Audience:** Public. Everyone.
* **Purpose:** Sharing the content I create, sharing other people's stuff that inspires me, learning about tech, design, & urbanism worlds, reaching out and connecting with folks. 
* **Type of Content:** Audio, Gifs, Images, Text, Video
* **Insights:** Twitter is my curating platform. It's a smorgasbord of everything I do, as well as things/folks/discplines I'm interacting with. I've used twitter time and time again to make professional acquaintences, and I follow people from whom I want to learn. I don't follow brands anymore, I keep them in a list and refer to the every now and then. Once you get over the constant ass-load of streaming content, it become pretty great. Like you're own little news feed. Also, Nuzzel is a great complimentary app that aggregates multiple posts from folks you're following.  

### Snapchat - patrickm02L
* **Audience:** Public. Everyone.
* **Purpose:** Short stories capturing a day-to-day record of things I'm working on. 
* **Type of Content:** Images, Video
* **Insights:** There are two main fuctions Stories and Individual Snaps. Stories stay up for 24hrs, and individual snaps end after the other person opens it. I think of snapchat as a photo/vid journal. Behind the scenes. I snap pretty often, much like I did when I started using Instagram (see insights above), then I'll save the snaps to the story feature, so you'll get a daily story. On occasion, I'll send direct customized snaps to folks for more personal engagement. I think snapchat is becoming increasingly more important because it provides a limited time glimpse into life, so you're compelled to tune in. Once you wrap your brain around it, snapchatting becomes as easy as text messaging.  

### Tumblr - [patrickm02L.com](http://patrickm02l.com/)
* **Audience:** Public.
* **Purpose:** BIG DEAL for me! This is my repository of all the digital content I create. It's my 'Document Everything' premise. 
* **Type of Content:** All types of digital content - Audio, Data, Flyers, Gifs, Illustrations, Images, Maps, Reads, Talks, and Video.
* **Insights:** I decided that websites are too limiting because you don't get to show all the inbetween stuff that happens while you're creating. I shifted my thinking to include all the digital content I create as a project. After doing this for over a year, I'm amazed to see how the things that I'm creating are all inter-related. I guess you could say it's all on BIG project! Also, after creating content, I like to go back and group it into collections, which I post on LinkedIn or now on my GitHub pages that I'm learning to use. I think as we continue to become more mobile oriented we'll expect brands to generate daily content for us to consume. I like tumblr because it's an inherently mobile platform and lends itself to a streaming/feed consumption. Documentation is Marketing!

### Vine - [patrickm02L](https://vine.co/patrickm02L)
* **Audience:** Public. 
* **Purpose:** Short messages on twitter, occasional observations.
* **Type of Content:** Videos
* **Insights:** For me Vine is hit and miss. I like that it's integrated with twitter and that the video play directly on the platform, so I'll use it to make announcements or edit a small clip from a video I'm promoting. There are people that are really popular on Vine. I'm not looking for that, I'm just using it to push folks to my other content. 

### YouTube - [patrickm02L](https://www.youtube.com/user/patrickm02L)
* **Audience:** Public. 
* **Purpose:** Story-telling, Tutorials, Promos, Story-telling, and Documentation
* **Type of Content:** Video
* **Insights:** To me YouTube is Google's social media platform not G+. I only see video content becoming more and more prevelant and strongly suggest everyone get their own YouTube Channel.
