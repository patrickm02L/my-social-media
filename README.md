## About
If you're doing cool shit people want to know about it! They want to access it, and they want to access you. 

I've created this repo to link you to my social, but also to give you a sense of how to use it. Yes, it's a skill, and you need to get good at it - especially if you're a creator. You made it, you need to get credit for it.

### Defining Premises
* Document Everything!
* It doesn't matter what you do IRL, on the Internet you're a content creator. 
* Four Basic Types of Content: Audio, Images, Text, Video
* You don't need a website. Instead, keep a blog where you catch all the digital content you make. 
* Treat each social media application as a collection of your Basic Type of Content.
* Respect the native format.  
* Meet people, share, and Have fun!

* Type of Content: Images
* Insights: When I first started I Instagrammed everything, about a year into it I noticed that there were some really good folks who could tell great stories with their pics. If you don't have any photography experience it's okay. Symmetry, rule of thirds, perspective. Also, get an app to add filters. I like VSCO cam. 

### LinkedIn - [patrickm02L](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickm02l)

* Insights: LinkedIn a timeline of your work history. It's the new resume. So get one! The pay off is that when other people search you they can see that you're connected to someone they know. Other than that, I've found that it's a good place to post my articles, conference news, and opportunies.

### Tumblr - [patrickm02L.com](http://patrickm02l.com/)

* Purpose: BIG DEAL! This is my repository of all the digital content I create. 
* Type of Content: All types of digital content - Audio, Data, Flyers, Gifs, Illustrations, Images, Maps, Read, Talks, and Video.
* Insights: I decided that websites are too limiting because you don't get to show all the inbetween stuff that happens while you're creating. I shifted my thinking to include all the digital content I create as a project. After doing this for over a year, I'm amazed to see how the things that I'm creating are all inter-related. I guess you could say it's all on BIG project! Also, after creating content, I like to go back and group it into collections, which I post on LinkedIn or now on my GitHub pages that I'm learning to use. 

### Vine - [patrickm02L](https://vine.co/patrickm02L)
* Audience: Public. 
* Purpose: Short messages on twitter, occasional observations.
* Type of Content: Videos
* Insights: For me Vine is hit and miss. I like that it's integrated with twitter and that the video play directly on the platform, so I'll use it to make announcements or edit a small clip from a video I'm promoting. There are people that are really popular on Vine. I'm not looking for that, I'm just using it to push folks to my other content.
