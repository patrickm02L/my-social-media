## About
If you're doing cool shit people want to know about it, they want to access it and they want to access you. 

I've thought long and hard about the importance of social media and I think it's vital that people who create stuff need to add social to their game. You make it, you need to get credit for it. 

I've created this repo to link you to my social, but also to give you a sense of how to use it. Yes, it's a skill, and you need to get good at it - especially if you're a creator. You made it, you need to get credit for it.

### Defining Premises
* Document Everything!
* It doesn't matter what you do IRL, on the Internet you're a content creator. 
* Four Basic Types of Content: Audio, Images, Text, Video
* You don't need a website. Instead, keep a blog where you catch all the digital content you make. 
* Treat each social media application as a collection of your Basic Type of Content.
* Respect the native format.
